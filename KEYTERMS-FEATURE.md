# ðŸŽ¯ Domain-Specific Terms Feature (Keyterms Prompt)

## Overview

The **Keyterms Prompt** feature leverages AssemblyAI's slam-1 model to improve transcription accuracy for domain-specific vocabulary. This feature allows users to provide contextual terms that help the AI better understand specialized language in their audio content.

## How It Works

### Backend Implementation
- **Parameter**: `keyterms_prompt` (string, optional)
- **Model Support**: Only available with `slam-1` speech model
- **API Endpoint**: `/transcribe` (POST)
- **Validation**: Automatically applied only when slam-1 model is selected

### Frontend Implementation
- **Component**: `KeytermsPrompt.jsx` - Dedicated UI for entering domain-specific terms
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when slam-1 model is selected
- **Character Limit**: 500 characters with live counter
- **Examples**: Built-in examples for different domains

## Usage

### 1. Select slam-1 Model
First, choose the "Slam-1" model in the Speech Model selection:
- Enhanced accuracy for specialized vocabulary
- Contextual understanding capabilities
- Domain-specific term support

### 2. Enter Domain-Specific Terms
When slam-1 is selected, the "Domain-Specific Terms" section appears:
- Enter relevant terms, names, or context
- Use the provided examples as templates
- Include technical jargon, proper names, acronyms

### 3. Example Use Cases

**Medical Transcription:**
```
Medical terms: stethoscope, diagnosis, prescription, symptoms, cardiovascular, hypertension
```

**Legal Transcription:**
```
Legal terms: plaintiff, defendant, jurisdiction, litigation, deposition, subpoena
```

**Technical Meetings:**
```
Technical terms: API, database, authentication, deployment, microservices, Kubernetes
```

**Business Calls:**
```
Business terms: revenue, stakeholder, quarterly, metrics, ROI, KPI, synergy
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Keyterms
1. **Be Specific**: Include exact terms that appear in your audio
2. **Include Variations**: Add different forms of the same term
3. **Proper Names**: Include names of people, companies, products
4. **Acronyms**: Spell out acronyms and their full forms
5. **Context**: Provide brief context for ambiguous terms

### Example Format
```
Company names: Acme Corp, TechStart Inc
Product names: CloudSync, DataFlow Pro
Technical terms: API gateway, microservices architecture
People: Dr. Sarah Johnson, CEO Mike Chen
```

## Limitations

- **Model Dependency**: Only works with slam-1 model
- **Character Limit**: Maximum 500 characters
- **Language**: Optimized for English content
- **Context**: Works best with clear, relevant terms
